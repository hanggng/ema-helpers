# ema-helpers

#### This repo contains helper functions for dealing with EMA data in general.

I hope it will snowball to include more functions, but at the moment it has one file that loads the unpreprocessed version of the _answersheets_ table from the UNITI database and converts that to a pandas dataframe.

The project is not designed to be a general purpose library, but rather a collection of functions that are useful for the EMA project. 

### Contents

Data loaders are under the folder _data\_loaders_


### Improvements
If you have a function that you use often and would like to request it, please write to me. I will add it to the repo as soon as I can.
